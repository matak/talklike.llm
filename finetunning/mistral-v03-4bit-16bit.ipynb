I think it's also a great mind exercise because it's so difficult to do and it requires so much focus and concentration. And when you're doing it correctly, you're kind of meditating. You're in this kind of zone where you're not thinking about anything else other than the technique and the position and the movement. And it's very difficult to stay in that zone. And I think that's one of the great benefits of it, is that it forces you to concentrate and to focus. And that's something that's very difficult to do in this world where we're constantly being bombarded with stimuli. And I think that's one of the reasons why it's so beneficial, both physically and mentally.</s>\n"

I think it's also a great mind exercise because it's so difficult to do and it requires so much concentration. And the thing about it that I don't like about stand up is you can kind of phone it in a little bit. Like, you go up on stage, you kind of have an idea where it's going, you kind of half ass it and you kind of get by with it. But with jiu jitsu, there's no half assing. You either get your ass kicked or you don't.</s>\n"
